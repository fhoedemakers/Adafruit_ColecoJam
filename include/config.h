// USB CLOCK TEST MODE -- diagnostic only, video will not work.
//
// Set to 1 to run the most reference-like configuration possible: clk_sys at
// 120 MHz (the value the known-working PIO-USB examples use), pll_usb left
// alone at its stock 48 MHz, and no HSTX clock set up at all. Video is forced
// off because there is no 126 MHz source in this mode.
//
// This answers one question: does PIO-USB work on this board with this code
// once our unusual three-PLL clock tree is out of the picture? If the host
// still hangs here, the clock tree was never the problem.
//
// Defined first because the clock settings below depend on it.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Which video driver to build.
//
//   VIDEO_DRIVER_HSTX      the built-in DVI driver in video_hstx.cpp. Video
//                          only; sound must go to the codec.
//   VIDEO_DRIVER_PICO_HDMI the pico_hdmi library, which adds HDMI data islands
//                          and therefore sound over the same cable.
//
// pico_hdmi owns core 1 and derives clk_hstx as clk_sys / PICO_HDMI_HSTX_CLK_DIV,
// so clk_sys must be 126 MHz times that divider -- see the clock block above.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#define VIDEO_DRIVER_HSTX       0
#define VIDEO_DRIVER_PICO_HDMI  1

// NOTE: if you change this, change VIDEO_DRIVER_IS_PICO_HDMI in CMakeLists.txt
// to match. CMake cannot read this header, and it needs to know: the library
// driver requires the image to run from RAM rather than XIP.

#define USB_CLOCK_TEST_MODE 0

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Clocks
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 252 MHz gives an exact 126 MHz HSTX clock (252/2), which is 5x the 25.2 MHz
// pixel clock of 640x480p60 -- so DVI comes out at a true 60 Hz that every
// monitor accepts. It also leaves ~70x realtime headroom over the 3.58 MHz Z80.
// Clocks.
//
// clk_sys MUST be an integer multiple of 12 MHz: Pico-PIO-USB derives its USB
// bit timing by dividing clk_sys, and a non-integer ratio produces invalid USB
// signalling that takes the shared TinyUSB stack down with it.
//
// The rest depends on which video driver is built:
//
//   VIDEO_DRIVER_PICO_HDMI
//     The library sets clk_hstx = clk_sys / PICO_HDMI_HSTX_CLK_DIV, an integer
//     divide, and 640x480p60 needs 126 MHz. Divider 2 gives clk_sys = 252 MHz,
//     which is 21 x 12 -- so HDMI and PIO-USB agree on one PLL and pll_usb is
//     left alone at its stock 48 MHz for the USB device.
//
//   VIDEO_DRIVER_HSTX
//     Our own driver can source clk_hstx from anywhere, so clk_sys runs at
//     240 MHz for PIO-USB and clk_hstx comes from a retuned pll_usb. That
//     needs clk_usb re-sourced onto pll_sys first -- see setup_clocks().

// Pin assignments taken from the reference CircuitPython implementation:
// https://github.com/cogliano/Fruit_Jam_ColecoVision_Cartridge_Reader
//
// The shield borrows pins the rest of the board also uses. GPIO 20/21 are the
// audio codec's I2C bus and GPIO 8/9 are the debug UART, so cart_present()
// hands them back when no cartridge is found. Configure the codec BEFORE
// touching the cartridge, which is the order main() already uses.
// LATCH PIN VARIANT. The reference project contradicts itself here, and the
// two sources cannot both be right:
//
//   0 = latch on GPIO 43 (board A3), data bit 6 on GPIO 8   [code.py]
//   1 = latch on GPIO 8,             data bit 6 on GPIO 43  [README table]
//
// code.py drives A3 as the latch and lists D8 among the data pins; the
// README's wiring table runs GPIO 8 to 74HC595 pin 12, which is RCLK. The
// comments in code.py mention "version 1" and "version 2" boards, so these are
// probably different shield revisions.
//
// Symptom of getting it wrong: the address never reaches the cartridge, so
// every offset returns the same byte.
//
// Both variants showed that symptom while the shift registers were being
